   <h3> Story of my dog Typhoon:</h3>
   <p>When he was small, I took him as a different breed)) But when he began to grow up, it became clear that this is a different breed) But there was no going back and we got used to each other, all the shoes were eaten, all the wires were destroyed) ) But that was in the past)) Now he is my best friend and protector ❤️</p>
