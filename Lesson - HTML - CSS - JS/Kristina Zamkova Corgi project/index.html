                        <p>I just adore this breed of dog. They are always <b>smiling</b> . Looking at them, I see a
                            little
                            anchony, it's so
                            funny.
                            They love to run and play, especially, with other breeds of dogs. Sometimes, their owner is
                            jealous of other
                            people or animals.</p>
                        <p>By the way, this is small tipe of sheep breed that was created an <b>Wales</b> . There is
                            information that this
                            breed was
                            created specifically for grazing cows.</p>
                        <p>These pets are<b>great friends, loyal and kind</b> . They get along easily with other breeds
                            of
                            dogs, are brave
                            and are
                            not afraid of big dogs. </p>
                        <p>Having a Corgi dog means having a beautiful and cheerful family friend who will please the
                            owner's eye.</p>
