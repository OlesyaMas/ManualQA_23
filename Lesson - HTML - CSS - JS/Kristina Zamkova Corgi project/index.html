        <h3>A pet that can be loved for a smile</h4>
    </div>
    <p>I just adore this breed of dog. They are always <b>smiling</b> . Looking at them, I see a little anchony, it's so
        funny.
        They love to run and play, especially, with other breeds of dogs. Sometimes, their owner is jealous of other
        people or animals.</p>
    <p>By the way, this is small tipe of sheep breed that was created an <b>Wales</b> . There is information that this
        breed was
        created specifically for grazing cows.</p>
    <p>These pets are<b>great friends, loyal and kind</b> . They get along easily with other breeds of dogs, are brave
        and are
        not afraid of big dogs. </p>
    <p>Having a Corgi dog means having a beautiful and cheerful family friend who will please the owner's eye.</p>
